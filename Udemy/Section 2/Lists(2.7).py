#string is basically only words
#lists can contain any data type i.e., int, float, str
#lists are denoted with []

s = 'Hello'
print(s)

l = ['Hello', 2, 2.5]

print(l)

#you can extract & index from a list just like a string
print(l[2])
print(l[0])
print(l[:2])

#COME BACK TO LISTS TO SEE WHY BELOW DOES NOT WORK!
print(l.remove(2))
